Feature: Implementation of the InferenceEngine for Variational Inference
  As a researcher, I want to use the VIEngine for Variational Inference
  so that I can perform variational inference using thunderpath.

  Background:
    Given I have imported the InferenceEngine and VIEngine classes from the thunderpath.inference module

  Scenario: Use VIEngine for Variational Inference
    Given I create a VIEngine instance that inherits from the InferenceEngine interface
    When I define the required methods for the VIEngine instance
    Then the VIEngine instance should be a valid implementation of the InferenceEngine interface
    And I can perform variational inference using the VIEngine instance
